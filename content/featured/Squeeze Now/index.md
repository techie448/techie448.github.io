Easy Shortener now is a utility which helps shorten URLs to a smaller length with duplicate checks, custom or auto-generated slugs available.
The project uses Vercel Serverless Node Cloud Functions to operate and a static Vue.js application to handle API requests for the frontend.
The project also hosts an API with public access for anyone to use or build upon a front-end application.
